## Transaction retries: exponential backoff with jitter

`TransactionQueue` submits transactions through the Soroban RPC with a retry
policy designed to survive network congestion without making it worse. Instead
of fixed-interval retries — which cause every client to hit the network in
lockstep (a "thundering herd") — failed submissions are retried with
**exponential backoff and jitter**, bounded by a **circuit breaker**.

### Behavior

- **Exponential backoff** — the delay between retries grows as
  `baseDelayMs * 2^attempt`, capped at `maxDelayMs`.
- **Jitter** — a random `0 … jitterFactor * delay` is added to each delay so
  concurrent retriers spread out instead of retrying in sync.
- **Retry-After** — `429` (rate-limited) responses that carry a `Retry-After`
  header (delta-seconds or HTTP-date) are honored; that delay takes precedence
  over the computed backoff (still bounded by `maxDelayMs`).
- **Circuit breaker** — after `circuitBreakerThreshold` consecutive retryable
  failures the breaker opens, the queue is paused, and a `CircuitBreakerError`
  is thrown so callers can report the endpoint as unhealthy.
- **Permanent failures are not retried** — a submission the RPC rejects outright
  (`ERROR` status) fails fast rather than consuming retry budget.
- **Structured logging** — every retry decision is reported to an optional
  `logger` with the attempt number, delay, and reason
  (`error` | `rate-limited` | `circuit-open` | `exhausted`).

### Configuration

Retry tunables default to the environment, and can be overridden per queue.

| Environment variable                 | Default | Meaning                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `TX_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`              | `5`     | Max attempts (including the first) per submit  |
| `TX_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_MS`             | `1000`  | Base delay for the exponential term            |
| `TX_RETRY_MAX_DELAY_MS`              | `30000` | Upper bound on a single delay                  |
| `TX_RETRY_JITTER_FACTOR`             | `0.5`   | Jitter window as a fraction of the delay (0–1) |
| `TX_RETRY_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` | `5`     | Consecutive failures before the breaker opens  |

### Usage

```ts
import { TransactionQueue, ConnectionHealthMonitor } from "linkora-sdk";

const health = new ConnectionHealthMonitor(rpcUrl);

const queue = new TransactionQueue({
  signer,
  rpc,
  // Per-queue overrides (any omitted field falls back to the env defaults):
  retry: { maxAttempts: 5, baseDelayMs: 1000, maxDelayMs: 30000, jitterFactor: 0.5 },
  // Surface retry telemetry + circuit-breaker health through the monitor:
  logger: (info) => health.recordRetry(info),
});

queue.enqueue(xdr1).enqueue(xdr2);

try {
  await queue.run();
} catch (err) {
  if (queue.isCircuitOpen) {
    // Endpoint is unhealthy — back off before submitting more work.
  }
  throw err;
}
```

The lower-level primitives (`backoffWithJitter`, `CircuitBreaker`,
`parseRetryAfter`, `withRetry`) are exported directly for reuse.
